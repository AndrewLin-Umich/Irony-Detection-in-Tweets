# Irony-Detection-in-Tweets

As the use of social media increase rapidly in our daily life, the use of language online is getting creative and diverse. Detecting irony becomes an important task as it might reverse the semantic meaning of sentences. It remains a non-trivial task, since we usually detect irony with the help of facial expressions and tones, neither of which is available in tweets. An automated classifier certainly will alleviate the burden of such tasks.

The task of the project is straight forward: to build a classifier to detect irony in tweets. The project was proposed by The International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2018 (SemEval-2018).
The training data is provided by the SemEval-2018. It is collected using hashtags (e.g. #irony, #sarcasm) and labeled manually.
